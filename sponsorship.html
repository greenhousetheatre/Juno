	   <div style="text-align:center"> <i>&ldquo;Public opinion around the world is that our leaders, governments and businesses should be doing more on this vital issue. This can be seen in some unexpected ways, such as the rise of veganism and flexitarian eating, as people seek to reduce their impact on the climate from eating meat. Through well-publicised and effective movements and actions, more and more people are refusing silently to acquiesce in ignoring the dangers to the climate.&rdquo; &mdash; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/02/climate-change-environment-2019-future-reasons-hope">Fiona Harvey, Environment Writer, The Guardian, Jan 2019.</a></i></div><br><br>

		<p><div style="text-align:left">Millions of people from around the globe, rank sustainability and climate change as one of the top issues in their lives. It is a hot topic with a lot of momentum and visibility, being debated and acted upon at every level &mdash; from intergovernmental summits, to school children taking to the streets in protest. <b>And it is a topic that is particularly relevant to young people &mdash; according to British Social Attitudes from the National Centre for social research, <a href="http://www.bsa.natcen.ac.uk/media/39251/bsa35_climate_change.pdf"> &lsquo;31% of 18-34 year olds are &ldquo;very&rdquo; or &ldquo;extremely&rdquo; worried about climate change compared with just 19% of over-65s&rsquo;.</b></a>  <br><br>
            The team behind The Greenhouse will be working tirelessly to tackle this issue.<br><br>
            Throughout the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, we will be using our skills as artists to engage with hundreds of thousands of Fringe-goers, generating real momentum for a positive change. All the while, we will also forming a community of artists and businesses to experiment with working in a more sustainable manner. We will explore everything from creative practice to organisational methods, building a space for like-minded creatives to share ideas and develop as a community.<br><br>
            The project begins here &mdash; with exploring how the Edinburgh Fringe can be more sustainable &mdash; and it will live on. With a clear and concise plan on how The Greenhouse can grow and develop over the coming five to ten years, we will lead a grass-roots and artist led approach to a more sustainable arts sector and a more sustainable future. <br><br>
            We are currently looking for businesses both from Edinburgh and from further afield who might be interested in sponsoring this project. By partnering with us, your brand will reach hundreds of thousands of audience members in Edinburgh and will leave a lasting impact on the largest arts festival in the world. You will also be making a significant contribution to preserving Edinburgh&rsquo;s cultural heritage while protecting its natural environment.<br><br>
            If you are interested in working with us on this, please feel free to take a look at our sponsorship pack below &mdash; it explains a little bit more about The Greenhouse, and all the benefits you can expect to receive as a partner. Alternatively, we would be more than happy to have a chat with you about what we&rsquo;re doing, and to develop a sponsorship package tailored specifically to you and your brand &mdash; just email <a href="mailto:info@thegreenhousetheatre.com?Subject=Sponsorship">info@thegreenhousetheatre.com</a> and we can get you started!
